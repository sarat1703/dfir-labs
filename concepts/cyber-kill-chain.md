## 🔍 What is the Cyber Kill Chain?
The Cyber Kill Chain is a model developed by Lockheed Martin to describe the stages of a cyberattack.

## 📊 The 7 Stages:
1. **Reconnaissance** – Gathering info about the target
2. **Weaponization** – Creating a malicious payload
3. **Delivery** – Sending the payload (email, USB, etc.)
4. **Exploitation** – Payload is activated
5. **Installation** – Malware is installed
6. **Command & Control (C2)** – Attacker gains remote access
7. **Actions on Objectives** – Data theft, destruction, or other goals

## 🧠 Why It Matters in DFIR:
- Helps analysts understand attacker behavior
- Guides detection at each phase
- Supports building defense strategies

## 🔄 Next Step:
Document real-world example mapping to the kill chain.
