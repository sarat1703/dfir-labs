## ðŸ§± What is the Pyramid of Pain?

A model that describes how difficult it is for an attacker to change certain indicators (IOCs) after detection:

- **Hash Values** â€“ Easy to change
- **IP Addresses** â€“ Easy to rotate
- **Domain Names** â€“ A bit harder
- **Network/Host Artifacts** â€“ Hard
- **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures)** â€“ Very hard

## ðŸ§  Takeaway:
- Defenders should focus on detecting TTPs, not just basic IOCs.
- Higher up the pyramid = more disruption to the attacker.

## ðŸ”„ Next Step:
Document how tools like MITRE ATT&CK map to TTP detection.
